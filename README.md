<h1>Coachable</h1>
<h4>Interview for fun, get hired for real!</h4>

<p>Coachable is a fun and easy way to become a better interviewee, faster. Answer questions and race the clock while being scored on what you say (or don't say!). Enter questions from previous interviews to train, and see how your results stack up on the scoreboard.</p> 


<h2>About this Project</h2>

Coachable is built with a React frontend and Rails backend and PostgreSQL for database management. It uses Web Speech API for voice recognition and voice-to-text, along with React Confetti component with some custom Canvas. </p>
